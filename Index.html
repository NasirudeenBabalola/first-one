      William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is an American business
      magnate, investor, author, philanthropist, and humanitarian. He is best
      known as the principal founder of Microsoft Corporation. During his career
      at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, CEO and chief software
      architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder until May
      2014. In 1975, Gates and Paul Allen launched Microsoft, which became the
      world's largest PC software company. Gates led the company as chief
      executive officer until stepping down in January 2000, but he remained as
      chairman and created the position of chief software architect for himself.
      In June 2006, Gates announced that he would be transitioning from
      full-time work at Microsoft to part-time work and full-time work at the
      Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the private charitable foundation that he
      and his wife, Melinda Gates, established in 2000. He gradually transferred
      his duties to Ray Ozzie and Craig Mundie. He stepped down as chairman of
      Microsoft in February 2014 and assumed a new post as technology adviser to
      support the newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.
